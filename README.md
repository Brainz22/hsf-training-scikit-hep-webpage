# Scikit-HEP tutorial

This is a tutorial on [Scikit-HEP](https://scikit-hep.org), a collection of packages for particle physics analysis in Python.

It was written by [Jim Pivarski][jpivarski] using the [Software Carpentry's][carpentries] lesson template and first taught during a [Software Carpentry Workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1097111/timetable/#day-2021-12-15) on December 15, 2021.

This repository builds a webpage that is live [here](https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-scikit-hep-webpage/)!

The Scikit-HEP tutorial is part of the [HSF training curriculum](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/training/curriculum).
